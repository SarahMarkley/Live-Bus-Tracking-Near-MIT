Title: Real Time Bus Tracker

Description:  The Real Time Bus Tracker tracks a bus in real time while it travels to different bus stops around MIT. You can click on the icon to bring up the headsign and available seating information as well.

How to Run: In order to run the real time bus tracker, download index.html, mapAnimation.js, redBus.png, and style.css into the same directory. Once you download the files, please edit the access token from the public token to your own personal token.  Open index.html in your preferred browser and click the "Show Live Bus" button in the top left corner for the bus to appear. If you click on the bus icon, it will bring up the headsign and available seating information as well.

Roadmap of future improvements: In the future, it would be helpful to add additional buses and more information about the bus being tracked.
