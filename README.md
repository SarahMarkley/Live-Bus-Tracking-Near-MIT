# Live-Bus-Tracking-Near-MIT
 The Live Bus Tracking Near MIT tracks a bus in real time while it travels to different bus stops around MIT. You can click on the icon to bring up the headsign and available seating information as well.
 In order to run the program, you will first download the index.html and redBus.png files. Once you download the files, please edit the access token from the public token to your own personal token. Click the "Show Live Bus" button in the top left corner for the bus to appear.
